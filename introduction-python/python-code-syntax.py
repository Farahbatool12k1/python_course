'''What is Syntax?
Syntax is the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language. 
In the case of a computer language, the syntax is the structural arrangement of comments, variables, numbers, 
operators, statements, loops, functions, classes, objects, etc. which helps us understand the meaning or
