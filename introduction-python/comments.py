'''Python Comments:
A comment is a part of the coding file that the programmer does not want to execute, rather 
the programmer uses it to either explain a block of code or to avoid the execution of a 
specific part of code while testing.

 

Single-Line Comments:
To write a comment just add a ‘#’ at the start of the line.

Example 1:

#This is a 'Single-Line Comment'
print("This is a print statement.")

multi lines comments:
To write a comment just add a single qoutes three lines or double qoutes lines  ''' or """at the start and end 
of the lines.
 
 Example :

'''This is a 'multi-single-qoutes-Lines Comment'''
print("This is a print statement.")

Example :

"""This is a multi-double-qoutes-Lines Comment"""
print("This is a print statement.") '''
