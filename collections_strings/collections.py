'''Collections (Arrays):
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:
1. List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
2. Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members
3.  Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members
4. Dictionary is a collection which is ordered (prior to Python 3.6,
   dictionaries were unordered) and changeable. No duplicate members.'''

'''note: string is unchangable but list is mutable means that is changable and flaxible.
tuple is immutable means that not changable .
