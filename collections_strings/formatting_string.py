'''Python String Formatting (f-Strings)
Python f-Strings makes it easy to print values and variables. For example,'''

name = 'Cathy'
country = 'UK'

print(f'{name} is from {country}')

'''Here, f'{name} is from {country}' is an f-string.

This new formatting syntax is powerful and easy to use. From now on, we will use f-Strings
 to print strings and variables.'''
